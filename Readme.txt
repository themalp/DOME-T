For producing a DOME-T adversarial examle of order k :

- RUN DOME-T.m IN MATHWORKS MATLAB AND CHOOSE THE DESIRABLE ORDER K (FOR EXAMLE 80) WHEN PROMPT.

(The order k must be an integer and smaller or equal than the resised image dimension.
25 to 50% of the dimension length would be fine.)

The other files contain functions that are necessary for DOME-T.m to run.
