# DOME-T
Source code for the DOME-T Adversarial Computer Vision Attack

For producing a DOME-T adversarial examle of order k :
- DOWNLOAD ALL THE FILES IN ONE DIRECTORY
- ADD YOUR IMAGES IN THE FILE "Images"
  (there are allready 3 sample images as an example but you can substitute them)

- RUN "DOME-T.m" CODE IN MATHWORKS MATLAB AND CHOOSE THE DESIRABLE ORDER K (FOR EXAMLE 120) WHEN PROMPT.
  (The order k must be an integer and smaller or equal than the resised image dimension.
  25 to 50% of the dimension length would be fine.)
  
- OUTPUT IMAGES WILL BE EXTRACTED IN THE "Output" FILE.

The other files contain functions that are necessary for DOME-T.m to run.
